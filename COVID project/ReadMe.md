This [Figure](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/blob/master/COVID%20project/COVID%20new%20cases.png) is the result of running the current code. It represents the number of new cases per million of people for some countries. Interestingly, first wave has started more or less at the same time in the different countries of Europe. The second wave has started in Spain before other countries. However, it is possible to see that eastern countries started to show a small rise at the beginning of October. Interestingly, the number of cases in Czechia have increased exponentially in the middle of this month.
The next [Figure](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/blob/master/COVID%20project/COVID%20new%20deaths.png) represents the number of deaths per day. First wave has been clearly more deadly than the second one. Another interesting fact is that western countries faced more deaths compared to eastern countries. Germany, which is in the middle of Europe, showed a number of new deaths between western and eastern countries.
Next [Figure](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/blob/master/COVID%20project/COVID%20beds.png) represents the number of available beds per thousand of people. Looks like countries like Spain and Italy do not have too many beds, which might influence the death rate because hospitals can become saturated easily. However, more data is necessary to study this variable since it does not take into account the new beds prepared during the coronavirus crisis.

I was also curious to know if there is an influence in the diet (vegetarian-based or meat-based) and the possibility to get infected with COVID. I have found the data from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset) and studied the correlation.

It looks like there is not a strong correlation between the consumption of meat products and the death rate (value are not higher than 0.5). However, it is possible to see that a vegetarian diet might be better due to the negative correlation values. And it also helps people to avoid obesity. Maybe, I should change my eating habits :)

Also, I would like to know, which countries have a higher degree of obesity. For this, I am plotting the following map: [LINK](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/blob/master/COVID%20project/mymap.html). 

You might need to download this map and opening it with your browser since sometimes github is not showing it.
From this map, looks like the countries with the highest values of obesity are USA and Saudi Arabia.
