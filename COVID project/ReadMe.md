This [Figure](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/blob/master/COVID%20project/COVID%20new%20cases.png) is the result of running the current code. It represents the number of new cases per million of people for some countries. Interestingly, first wave has started more or less at the same time in the different countries of Europe. The second wave has started in Spain before other countries. However, it is possible to see that eastern countries show a small rise at the beginning of October, which might mean that they are at the beginning of the second wave.
The next [Figure](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/blob/master/COVID%20project/COVID%20new%20deaths.png) represents the number of deaths per day. First wave has been clearly more deadly than the second one. Another interesting fact is that western countries faced more deaths compared to eastern countries. Germany, which is in the middle of Europe, showed a number of new deaths between western and eastern countries.
Last [Figure](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/blob/master/COVID%20project/COVID%20beds.png) represents the number of available beds per thousand of people. Looks like countries like Spain and Italy do not have too many beds, which might influence the death rate because hospitals can become saturated easily. However, more data is necessary to study this variable since it does not take into account the new beds prepared during the coronavirus crisis.
