# Data Science Portfolio by Antonio García Marín
This portfolio is a compilation of projects that I have performed while learning and applying Python.

## Case study projects

### COVID19 analysis
In [this project](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/blob/master/COVID%20project/COVIDcases_analysis.py) I am downloading real-time data from a website and plotting some the number of new cases per million of people for some countries. If you want to include more countries, you only need to add more of them, as described in the code.
This [Figure](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/blob/master/COVID%20project/Figure%20COVID%20cases.png) is the result of running the current code.

## Simple projects

### Mean square displacement (MSD) analyzer
In [this code](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/blob/master/MSD-calculation.py) I am generating a random (brownian motion) 3D trayectory. From this trayectory I am calculating and plotting the corresponding MSD value. Useful for Biophysics.

### Non-linear regression of a dataset
In [this code](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/blob/master/Nonlinear_fitting_curves.py), I am generating a random 2D dataset. I am performing an exponential regression of this dataset and plotting it. Finally, I am calculating the goodness of fit.
