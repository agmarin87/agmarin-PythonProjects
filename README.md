# Data Science Portfolio by Antonio García Marín
This portfolio is a compilation of projects that I have performed while learning and applying Python. Feel free to use them. I would appreciate a lot if you acknowledge me if you use any of these codes I have submitted.

## Case study projects

### COVID19 analysis
In [this project](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/tree/master/COVID%20project) I am downloading real-time data from a website and plotting some data from some European countries. If you want to include more countries, you only need to add more of them, as described in the code.

## Simple projects

### Mean square displacement (MSD) analyzer
In [this code](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/blob/master/MSD-calculation.py) I am generating a random (brownian motion) 3D trayectory. From this trayectory I am calculating and plotting the corresponding MSD value. Useful for Biophysics.

### Mean square displacement (MSD) for multiple trajectories
In [this code](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/tree/master/MSD%20project) I am generating a "n" number of random (brownian motion) 3D trayectories. From this trayectory I am calculating and plotting the corresponding MSD value by using two different methods, as explained in the ReadMe file. Useful for Biophysics.

### Non-linear regression of a dataset
In [this code](https://github.com/agmarin87/agmarin-PythonProjects/blob/master/Nonlinear_fitting_curves.py), I am generating a random 2D dataset. I am performing an exponential regression of this dataset and plotting it. Finally, I am calculating the goodness of fit.
